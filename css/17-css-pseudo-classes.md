## Introduction

CSS pseudo-classes are special keywords used with CSS selectors to style an element based on a particular state, condition, or position.

A pseudo-class is written with a single colon (`:`) followed by its name.

For example:

```css
button:hover {
    background-color: steelblue;
}
```

Here:

```text
button
   ↓
Element selector

:hover
   ↓
Pseudo-class
```

The style is applied when the user hovers over the button.

### What Pseudo-Classes Can Represent

Pseudo-classes can represent different situations, such as:

- An element being hovered.
- An element being clicked or activated.
- An element receiving focus.
- A link that has already been visited.
- The first or last element in a group.
- An element at a particular position.
- A checked form control.
- A disabled form control.
- A valid or invalid form input.

### Common Examples

```css
:hover
:active
:focus
:visited
:link
:first-child
:last-child
:nth-child()
:not()
:checked
:disabled
:enabled
:valid
:invalid
```

For example:

```css
a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

```css
input:focus {
    border-color: steelblue;
}
```

```css
li:first-child {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

Each selector applies styles under a particular condition.

### Pseudo-Classes Do Not Create New Elements

A pseudo-class does not create an additional HTML element.

For example:

```css
button:hover {
    color: white;
}
```

The `:hover` pseudo-class simply adds a condition to the `button` selector.

```text
button
   +
:hover condition
   ↓
button:hover
```

### Pseudo-Class vs Normal Selector

A normal selector can select an element directly:

```css
button {
    background-color: gray;
}
```

A pseudo-class can select the same element under a specific condition:

```css
button:hover {
    background-color: steelblue;
}
```

Therefore:

```text
button
   ↓
All matching buttons

button:hover
   ↓
Matching buttons currently being hovered
```

### Why Pseudo-Classes Are Useful

Pseudo-classes allow CSS to respond to user interaction and document structure without requiring additional classes in many situations.

For example, instead of adding a special class to the first list item:

```html
<li class="first">One</li>
```

CSS can use:

```css
li:first-child {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

This allows the browser to determine which element matches the condition.

### Important Point

Pseudo-classes are an important part of CSS selectors because they allow styles to depend on an element's state, condition, or position.

The basic pattern is:

```css
selector:pseudo-class {
    property: value;
}
```

> 💡 **Tip:** Think of a pseudo-class as an additional condition attached to a selector.

> 💡 **Remember:** CSS pseudo-classes use a single colon (`:`), such as `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:first-child`.
