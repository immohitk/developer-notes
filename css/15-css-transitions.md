## Introduction

CSS transitions allow CSS property values to change smoothly over a specified period of time.

Normally, when a CSS property changes, the browser applies the new value immediately. A transition makes the change gradual, creating a smoother visual effect.

For example, without a transition:

```css
button {
    background-color: steelblue;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: darkblue;
}
```

The button changes from `steelblue` to `darkblue` immediately when the user hovers over it.

With a transition:

```css
button {
    background-color: steelblue;
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: darkblue;
}
```

The background color now changes gradually over `0.3` seconds.

CSS transitions are commonly used for interactive effects such as:

- Hover effects
- Button interactions
- Links
- Cards
- Navigation menus
- Image effects
- Color changes
- Size changes
- Position changes
- Transform effects

> 💡 **Tip:** A transition does not create a new state by itself. It controls how smoothly a property changes from one value to another.

> 💡 **Remember:** CSS transitions are mainly used to make changes between CSS states appear smooth rather than immediate.
