# Introduction

CSS units define **how the browser measures lengths and sizes**.

Every visual property that represents size uses a CSS unit.

Examples include:

- Width
- Height
- Margin
- Padding
- Font size
- Border width
- Position offsets
- Grid tracks
- Flexbox sizing

Choosing the correct unit is just as important as choosing the correct CSS property.

For example:

```css
.box {
    width: 300px;
}
```

uses a fixed pixel value, while:

```css
.box {
    width: 50%;
}
```

creates a responsive width based on its parent element.

Similarly,

```css
font-size: 2rem;
```

behaves very differently from:

```css
font-size: 2em;
```

Understanding these differences helps you build layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, user preferences, and devices.

In this chapter, you'll learn the most common CSS units, how they work, when to use them, and which units are recommended for modern web development.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** There is no single "best" CSS unit. The right choice depends on what you're sizing and how you want it to respond to different screen sizes and user settings.
