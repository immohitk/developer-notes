## Introduction

Every HTML element has a **display type** that determines **how it appears and behaves within a webpage layout**.

Some elements naturally occupy an entire line, while others only take up as much space as their content requires. Some elements can be completely hidden, while others become flexible containers for advanced layouts.

The CSS **`display`** property allows you to control this behavior.

By changing an element's display type, you can completely alter how it interacts with surrounding elements without changing the HTML itself.

For example, you can:

- Make an inline element behave like a block element.
- Place multiple block elements on the same line.
- Hide elements from the page.
- Create flexible layouts with Flexbox.
- Build two-dimensional layouts with Grid.

Because of its versatility, the `display` property is one of the most frequently used properties in modern CSS.

In this chapter, you'll learn the most common display values, when to use them, how they affect layout, and how they serve as the foundation for advanced layout systems.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Before reaching for Flexbox or Grid, first ask yourself: *"How should this element behave?"* The answer often begins with choosing the correct `display` value.
